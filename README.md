<h3> Hey :) </h3>

I'm [Boris Russanov](https://s1gr4y.github.io/). Currently, I'm studying Computer Science at the University of Florida.\
I occasionally program when I am not reading any docs. My primary interests are in computer graphics and networking.\

I am most proficient in C/C++, but I still have a good deal of experience in Java, Python, and JavaScript.

Feel Free to take a look at my projects/repos!
