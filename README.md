<h2> Hey :) </h2>

I'm [Boris Russanov](https://s1gr4y.dev). I'm a software engineer with a master's in computer engineering from the University of Florida.\
Whenever I am not reading any docs, working, or learning, I put my side/main projects here. My primary interests are in computer graphics/vision, systems engineering, networking, and data analysis.

I am most proficient in C/C++, but I also use Python, Go, Java, and JavaScript.

Feel Free to take a look at my projects/repos!
